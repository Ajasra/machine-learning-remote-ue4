# tensorflow-remote-ue4
Tensorflow plugin for the Unreal Engine, encapsulating calls to remote python servers running Tensorflow.

Should have the same api as tensorflow-ue4, but with freedom to run a host server on platform of choice (e.g. remote win/linux instances).

Not yet functional see https://github.com/getnamo/tensorflow-remote-ue4/issues/1 for initial build status.
