# machine-learning-remote-ue4
Machine Learning plugin for the Unreal Engine, encapsulating calls to remote python servers running Tensorflow.

Should have the same api as tensorflow-ue4, but with freedom to run a host server on platform of choice (e.g. remote win/linux instances).

## Machine Learning Plugin Variants
